Here's a summary of how the app works and the plan for your requested changes:

How the App Works
main.py:
Entry point.
Sets up navigation options (NAVIGATION_OPTIONS), imports modules, and renders the sidebar and the selected page.
Uses nav_active in st.session_state to determine which page to render.
Pages are implemented as Python modules in /app/modules, each with a render() function.
components/sidebar.py:
Renders the sidebar, including logo, navigation, user info, and debug info.
Calls render_navigation from components/navigation.py to display navigation buttons.
The navigation options are passed as a list of tuples: (name, icon, key).
components/navigation.py:
render_navigation() renders navigation buttons in the sidebar.
Handles query parameters to sync navigation state.
Returns the selected page key.
modules folder:
Each page is a module (e.g., home.py, creators_engine_ia.py, feedback.py), each with a render() function.
The main app imports these and calls their render() based on the navigation state.
What I Will Do
Add three new modules (pages):
ai_labs.py
analytics.py
bigquery_filters.py
Each will have a simple render() function with placeholder text.
Update navigation:
Add the new pages to NAVIGATION_OPTIONS in main.py.
Ensure the new modules are imported and their render() functions are called when selected.
Let's proceed by creating the new modules and updating the navigation logic.
