Okay, let's get these files set up with your specific project details.

**Summary of Your Details:**

* **Project ID:** `fleet-gamma-448616-m1`
* **Region:** `us-central1`
* **Artifact Registry Repo:** `creatorsengine-app-repo`
* **Cloud Run Service (Dev):** `creatorsengine-dev`
* **Service Account:** `streamlit-app-runner@fleet-gamma-448616-m1.iam.gserviceaccount.com`

**Naming Convention We'll Use:**

* **Base Image Name:** `dev-base` (for the infrequently built image with dependencies)
* **Dev App Image Name:** `dev-app` (for the frequently built image with only code changes)

---

**Part 1: Infrequent Base Image Build (Run only when dependencies change)**

You'll need these three files for building the base image.

**1. `Dockerfile.base` (Place this in your project root or a dedicated `base/` subdir)**

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile.base

# Using Python 3.11 as an example, adjust if needed
FROM python:3.11-slim

# --- OS Dependencies ---
# Add any 'apt-get install' commands here if your app needs them
# Example:
# RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
#    package1 \
#    package2 \
#    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Prevent Python from writing pyc files and buffering stdout/stderr
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE 1
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1

# --- Python Dependencies ---
# Copy only the dependency definition file(s)
COPY requirements.txt ./
# If you have other files like setup.py or pyproject.toml, copy them too

# Install Python dependencies (This is the slow step we run infrequently)
# Using --no-cache-dir is good practice for image size
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# This image is just the base environment. No app code, no CMD needed here.
```

**2. `cloudbuild.base.yaml` (Place this next to `Dockerfile.base`)**

This tells Cloud Build how to build `Dockerfile.base`.

```yaml
# cloudbuild.base.yaml
steps:
  # Build the base image, ensuring it's for linux/amd64 (Cloud Run's architecture)
  # Cloud Build workers are typically amd64, but specifying platform is safest.
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
  args: [
      'build',
      '--platform', 'linux/amd64', # Explicitly target Cloud Run architecture
      '-t', '${_BASE_IMAGE_TAG}',
      '-f', 'Dockerfile.base',
      '.' # Build context directory
    ]

# Specify the image to be pushed to Artifact Registry
images:
- '${_BASE_IMAGE_TAG}'

options:
  # Use a machine type suitable for dependency installation if needed
  # machineType: 'E2_HIGHCPU_8'
  logging: CLOUD_LOGGING_ONLY

substitutions:
  _BASE_IMAGE_TAG: 'unset' # This will be provided by the build script
```

**3. `build-push-base.sh` (Script to trigger the base image build)**

Run this script *manually* or via a separate CI trigger *only* when `requirements.txt` or OS packages in `Dockerfile.base` change.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e # Exit on error
set -u # Treat unset variables as an error
# set -o pipefail # Exit if any command in a pipeline fails

echo "--- Starting Base Image Build ---"
START_TIME=$(date +%s)

# --- Configuration ---
PROJECT_ID="fleet-gamma-448616-m1"
REGION="us-central1"
REPO_NAME="creatorsengine-app-repo"
BASE_IMAGE_NAME="dev-base" # Name for the base image artifact

# Use a fixed tag like 'latest' or a version number for the base image
# Using 'latest' is common for the base image used by dev builds
TAG="latest"
# Alternatively use a version: TAG="v1.0"

BASE_IMAGE_TAG="${REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/${PROJECT_ID}/${REPO_NAME}/${BASE_IMAGE_NAME}:${TAG}"

echo "Project ID:       $PROJECT_ID"
echo "Region:           $REGION"
echo "Repo Name:        $REPO_NAME"
echo "Base Image Name:  $BASE_IMAGE_NAME"
echo "Full Base Image Tag: $BASE_IMAGE_TAG"
echo "---------------------------------"

# --- Submit Base Build to Cloud Build ---
# Ensure you are in the directory containing Dockerfile.base and cloudbuild.base.yaml
# Or adjust the '.' path below if they are in a subdirectory (e.g., 'base/.')
gcloud builds submit . \
  --project=$PROJECT_ID \
  --config=cloudbuild.base.yaml \
  --substitutions=_BASE_IMAGE_TAG="$BASE_IMAGE_TAG" \
  --region="$REGION" # Optional: run the build itself in a specific region

echo "---------------------------------"
echo "Base image build submitted."
echo "Image will be pushed to: $BASE_IMAGE_TAG"

END_TIME=$(date +%s)
TOTAL_TIME=$((END_TIME - START_TIME))
echo "Script finished in: $TOTAL_TIME seconds"
echo "--- Base Image Build Complete ---"

```

---

**Part 2: Frequent Development Build (Run every time you change code)**

You'll need these three files for your rapid development cycle.

**4. `Dockerfile.dev` (Your existing file, slightly adapted)**

This uses the pre-built base image and just adds your code.

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile.dev

# ARG to receive the base image tag from the build command
ARG BASE_IMAGE_TAG=us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/fleet-gamma-448616-m1/creatorsengine-app-repo/dev-base:latest

# --- Use your pre-built base image ---
FROM ${BASE_IMAGE_TAG}

# WORKDIR is already set to /app in the base image

# --- Application Code Layer ---
# Copy your application code (this should be very fast)
COPY . .

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 8080

# Set environment variables (these seem correct from your example)
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
ENV PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
ENV PORT=8080
ENV STREAMLIT_SERVER_PORT=8080
ENV STREAMLIT_SERVER_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0
ENV STREAMLIT_SERVER_ENABLE_CORS=false
ENV STREAMLIT_SERVER_ENABLE_XSRF_PROTECTION=false
ENV APPMODE="PROD" # Or maybe "DEV" for this workflow? Adjust as needed.

# Your CMD (seems correct from your example)
# Ensure dataretriever.py is part of the 'COPY . .'
CMD ["bash", "-c", "python /app/utils/dataretriever.py && exec streamlit run main.py --server.port=8080 --server.address=0.0.0.0"]
```

**5. `cloudbuild.dev.yaml` (Place this in your project root or `dev-ci/` subdir)**

This configuration builds `Dockerfile.dev`. It's very simple because the heavy lifting is done in the base image.

```yaml
# cloudbuild.dev.yaml (for fast code-only updates)
steps:
# 1 - Build the development app image using Dockerfile.dev
# This step assumes the base image already exists in Artifact Registry
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
  id: BuildDevAppImage
  args: [
      'build',
      # Tag the final image with a unique identifier (e.g., commit sha)
      '--tag=${_DEV_APP_IMAGE_TAG}',
      # Pass the base image tag to the Dockerfile.dev ARG
      '--build-arg',
      'BASE_IMAGE_TAG=${_BASE_IMAGE_TAG}',
      # Specify the development Dockerfile
      '-f', 'Dockerfile.dev',
      # Build context (current directory)
      '.'
    ]

# 2 - Push the uniquely tagged development app image
# This image only contains the code layer on top of the base.
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
  id: PushDevAppImage
  args: ['push', '${_DEV_APP_IMAGE_TAG}']

# Note: No explicit deployment step here. The deploy script handles it after the build.

# List the final image built by this pipeline
images:
- '${_DEV_APP_IMAGE_TAG}'

options:
  logging: CLOUD_LOGGING_ONLY
  # A standard machine type is usually fine for just copying code
  # machineType: 'E2_MEDIUM'

substitutions:
  # Provided by the deploy-dev.sh script
  _DEV_APP_IMAGE_TAG: 'unset' # e.g., us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/.../dev-app:commitsha
  _BASE_IMAGE_TAG: 'unset'    # e.g., us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/.../dev-base:latest
```

**6. `deploy-dev.sh` (Your script, adapted for the two-stage process)**

This script triggers the fast build (`cloudbuild.dev.yaml`) and then deploys the resulting image to Cloud Run.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e # Exit on error
set -u # Treat unset variables as an error
# set -o pipefail

echo "--- Starting Fast Dev Build & Deploy ---"

```

**How to Use:**

1.  Place `Dockerfile.base`, `cloudbuild.base.yaml`, and `build-push-base.sh` in your project (e.g., in the root or a `base/` subdirectory).
2.  Place `Dockerfile.dev` and `cloudbuild.dev.yaml` in your project (e.g., in the root or a `dev-ci/` subdirectory).
3.  Place `deploy-dev.sh` in your project root.
4.  **First time & whenever dependencies change:** Run `bash build-push-base.sh`.
5.  **Whenever you change application code:** Run `bash deploy-dev.sh`. This should now be significantly faster.

Remember to adjust paths in the scripts (`gcloud builds submit .`, `--config=...`) if you place the configuration files in subdirectories.





Architecture differences Fix: rebuild the base image with an amd64 (or multi-arch) manifest

Option A – fast one-off: cross-compile amd64 from your Mac  :

cd apps/ce_app.lab
export REGION=us-central1
export PROJECT_ID=fleet-gamma-448616-m1
export REPO_NAME=creatorsengine-app-repo
NEW_TAG="$(date +%Y%m%d).dev_ci"

docker buildx build \
  --platform linux/amd64 \
  --push \
  -t "$REGION-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/$REPO_NAME/dev-base:$NEW_TAG" \
  -f dev-ci/dev-base.Dockerfile .






1.
	Re-push the base image only when requirements.txt changes:
dev-ci/buildonce.sh

2.	For day-to-day code testing, run:
dev-ci/deploydev.sh
⟶ Cloud Build rebuilds only COPY . .; deploy completes in seconds.

That’s it—every file now points at
us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/fleet-gamma-448616-m1/creatorsengine-app-repo.

	•	To inspect what’s there (base, cache, dev-app images) run:

# list repos in the region
gcloud artifacts repositories list --location=us-central1

# list images in your repo
gcloud artifacts docker images list \
    us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/fleet-gamma-448616-m1/creatorsengine-app-repo

# inspect tags on the cache image (after first dev build)
gcloud artifacts docker tags list \
    us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/fleet-gamma-448616-m1/creatorsengine-app-repo/cache


Can the base image be reused for other apps?

Absolutely. The dev-base:* image just bundles Debian + Python + your common wheels.
Any app whose runtime requirements are the same (or a subset) can FROM …/dev-base:<tag> and enjoy the same fast incremental builds. Give the tag a clearer name if you like:
dev-base-creatorsengine:20250502
dev-base-<framework>:v0.1.0
as long as the full path is:
us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/fleet-gamma-448616-m1/creatorsengine-app-repo/<image>:<tag>


What to do next
	1.	Run dev-ci/deploydev.sh from the repo root – watch Cloud Build finish in under a minute.
	2.	Re-run it without changing any code – you should see the ~10 s “fully cached” build.
	3.	When you add new Python deps, rebuild the base once:

./dev-ci/buildonce.sh          # pushes dev-base:<newtag>







Why the private-repo image still “misses”
	•	Merely pushing an image (for example creators-engine-ia-app-image:latest) does not make it a usable layer-cache.
Docker/BuildKit can only reuse previous layers when the image also contains cache metadata (the so-called inline cache) or when you export a dedicated registry cache object.  ￼
	•	A pull that doesn’t carry that metadata looks to the builder like any other foreign image, so every RUN, COPY, … line is executed again even though the layers look identical inside the registry.

Fast-dev strategy that really avoids the 5-minute rebuild

<details>
<summary>1&nbsp;·&nbsp;Split the Dockerfile into a rarely-changed “dev base” and a tiny “app” stage</summary>


# ─── dev-base.Dockerfile ───────────────────────────────────────────
FROM python:3.11-slim-bullseye AS dev-base

# Only things that almost never change while you prototype
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
        libjpeg62-turbo libpng16-16 libfreetype6 \
        libssl1.1 libffi7 zlib1g && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Pre-install Python deps so you **never** run pip during dev builds
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --upgrade pip && \
    pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

Build once (or whenever you touch requirements.txt) and push to Artifact Registry:

docker buildx build \
  --push \
  -t $REGION-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/dev-base:$(date +%Y%m%d) \
  -f dev-base.Dockerfile .

# ─── Dockerfile.prod ───────────────────────────────────────────────
FROM $REGION-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/dev-base:20250502 AS app

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 PORT=8080
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "main.py"]

Now only the COPY . . layer is rebuilt when you change code; everything before it is frozen in the pre-built base image.

</details>


<details>
<summary>2&nbsp;·&nbsp;Turn on BuildKit and publish an inline+registry cache</summary>


Add one build step to cloudbuild.yaml; the rest of your pipeline (push, deploy) stays the same.

steps:
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
  id: build-fast
  env:
  - DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
  args:
  - buildx
  - build
  - --builder=default
  # embed cache into the image ➜ “inline”
  - --build-arg=BUILDKIT_INLINE_CACHE=1
  # import the previous run’s cache (ignore first-build error)
  - --cache-from=type=registry,ref=${_REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/${PROJECT_ID}/creatorsengine-cache:prod
  # export a fresh cache blob so the next VM can reuse it
  - --cache-to=type=registry,ref=${_REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/${PROJECT_ID}/creatorsengine-cache:prod,mode=max,compression=zstd
  - --tag=${_IMAGE_TAG}
  - --push
  - -f=.devcontainer/Dockerfile.prod
  - .
images:
- ${_IMAGE_TAG}

	•	Inline cache lets local Docker users pull the image and use the cache automatically.
	•	Registry cache stores every layer tarball once; the next Cloud-Build VM pulls only the changed ones.  ￼

Typical repeat build times drop to 4-10 s when just Python files change.

</details>


<details>
<summary>3&nbsp;·&nbsp;Skip the daily <code>apt-get update</code> churn entirely</summary>


Because your dev-base image already contains all system libraries, the runtime Dockerfile has no apt-get at all, so you’re not wasting time downloading package indexes every few hours.
If you ever need to refresh OS packages, rebuild dev-base explicitly; your production pipeline can still run a full update later.

</details>


<details>
<summary>4&nbsp;·&nbsp;Add a “force-rebuild” escape hatch</summary>


The only time you do want to invalidate everything is when you change requirements.txt or the OS libs.
Put this in your shell wrapper:

if [[ $FORCE_REBUILD == "1" ]]; then
  EXTRA_ARGS+=(--no-cache)
fi
gcloud builds submit "${EXTRA_ARGS[@]}" …

Run FORCE_REBUILD=1 ./app_build.sh and you get a completely fresh image; otherwise the cached one is reused for eight hours (or as long as your registry cache --cache-ttl allows).

</details>




⸻

Why this meets your stated goals

Goal	How it’s achieved
“Only code changes should rebuild.”	All heavy layers live in dev-base; the build step copies code and finishes.
“Finish in seconds, not minutes.”	BuildKit registry cache + tiny Dockerfile → repeat builds pull zero layers and reuse every instruction up to COPY . ..
“Optional opt-out (new dependency).”	Rebuild dev-base or set FORCE_REBUILD=1 when you really need updated libs/requirements.
“No security foot-gun in prod.”	Production Cloud Build trigger can keep using python:3.11-slim-bullseye + daily apt-get update; the dev pipeline is separate.



⸻

If you prefer Kaniko instead of BuildKit

Kaniko works too; enable --cache=true --cache-ttl=8h and point --cache-repo at the same Artifact Registry repository. The first build populates the cache; subsequent builds within eight hours will skip unchanged layers.  ￼
The BuildKit route is usually faster and lets you test locally with the same command.

⸻

TL;DR

Pre-build a “dev base” image with OS + pip packages, push once → tiny app Dockerfile reuses it.
Use docker buildx build in Cloud Build with inline + registry cache so even a brand-new VM finishes in single-digit seconds.
Flip a one-shot environment variable when you do want to bust the cache.

Kaniko vs BuildKit — a 3-minute executive summary

	BuildKit ( docker buildx )	Kaniko
What it is	The modern builder engine maintained by the Docker/Moby project. Powers docker build on recent Docker versions and Cloud Build’s “Docker” step when you set DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1.	A standalone container image ( gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor ) created by Google to build OCI images inside container-only environments that can’t run a Docker daemon.
Runs where	Anywhere Docker runs (desktop, VM, Cloud Build). Uses a lightweight in-process daemon on the build VM.	Inside any container runtime (Kubernetes, Cloud Build, GitHub Actions, etc.). No privileged mode needed.
Cache options	Inline cache (metadata stored in the image) plus remote registry cache (--cache-to / --cache-from). Can also share cache over a local directory.	Remote registry cache (--cache=true --cache-repo=…) with optional TTL (--cache-ttl=8h). No inline cache.
Multi-arch, advanced features	Yes — buildx does cross-compilation, QEMU emulation, SBOM attestation, provenance, secrets, SSH-agent forwarding.	Basic multi-arch via separate invocations. Fewer advanced features.
Speed profile	Fastest when you can mount the registry cache as a layer; incremental builds are often single-digit seconds.	Slightly slower because every layer is unpacked in user space, but still vastly faster than a clean rebuild.
Local dev parity	Excellent: the same docker buildx command works on your laptop and in CI.	Meant for CI; you wouldn’t usually call Kaniko locally.
When to choose	• You’re already using Docker in Cloud Build (default).• You want dev/CI parity and rich features.• Privileged Docker daemon is allowed (Cloud Build’s docker step runs in privileged mode by design).	• Your build environment forbids privileged containers (e.g., unprivileged Kubernetes pods).• You don’t need fancy features and like a single static binary.

Bottom line:
Cloud Build’s stock gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker + BuildKit is simpler and faster for your use-case. Kaniko is great when you have no Docker daemon at all, but you don’t have that constraint.

⸻

Organising dev vs prod pipelines in the same repo

Yes—keep everything in one repo and add a parallel “dev” build folder:

.
├─ cloudbuild.yaml            # ← production build & deploy
├─ .devcontainer/Dockerfile.prod
├─ deploy_prod.sh
├─ dev-ci/                    # ← all fast-loop assets live here
│   ├─ cloudbuild.dev.yaml
│   ├─ dev-base.Dockerfile
│   ├─ Dockerfile.dev         # (tiny stage that just does COPY . .)
│   └─ deploy_dev.sh

5 · Using it day-to-day

Action	Command
Fast inner loop (seconds)	./dev-ci/deploy_dev.sh — copies code, reuses all cached layers, deploys to a creatorsengine-dev Cloud Run service.
Full prod build (minutes)	./deploy_prod.sh (keeps your original cloudbuild.yaml, runs apt upgrade, etc.).

Because the dev Cloud Build file lives in dev-ci/, VS Code DevContainers won’t try to use it automatically, but you can still mount that folder in your devcontainer if you want both workflows inside the container.

⸻

Recap
	•	BuildKit is the simplest way to get repeat-build times down to ~5 s in Cloud Build.
	•	Put your speedy dev Dockerfile & Cloud Build YAML in a dev-ci/ sub-folder; keep production assets where they are.
	•	Pre-build a dev-base image with OS + pip deps; the daily dev build only does COPY . ..
	•	You decide when to bump the base tag (or set FORCE_REBUILD=1)—otherwise nothing heavier than your code is rebuilt.
